A simple FPS game where you have a minigun that shoots bees.
Uses the bees to lift objects and enemies out of your way!

Note for the AI agent requirement: Although there's only one enemy type, there are three 'AI agents' in the game: The bees, the space ship enemy, and the rockets that the ship shoots at the player.
